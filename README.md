#  Crop Recommendation Using Machine Learning

##  Overview
Agriculture plays a crucial role in the Indian economy, and selecting the right crop is essential for maximizing yield and sustainability.  
This project uses **Machine Learning** to recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation based on **soil and environmental parameters** such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

##  Purpose
The goal is to build an **intelligent crop recommendation system** that provides accurate suggestions using real-time data, helping farmers make informed decisions and improve productivity.

##  Objectives
- Develop a machine learning model for crop recommendation.
- Compare multiple ML models and select the most accurate one.
- Create a **Tkinter GUI** for user-friendly interaction.
- Provide recommendations among **22 crop types**.

##  Technology Stack
